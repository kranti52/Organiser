I have used Silex 1.3 with Material Design Lite as Css library and Twig(templating language).
I have added social login in this webapp using Gigablah/silex-oauth library.

This is a webapp which gives you feel of sticky notes to add some task which either you have to do or doing or done and in these task you can add subtask with the status of to do or doing or done.
